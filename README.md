WhatsApp cloud API java Wrapper.

I want to build a WhatsApp-cloud-API wrapper for Spring java.
The wrapper will be similar to https://github.com/Neurotech-HQ/heyoo.git heyoo Python wrapper.
Features that I want the project to have:
1. Send message to a customer.
2. Send bulk messages to customers.
3. Schedule bulk message to customers.
4. Filter customer and send them messages.
5. Receive messages from client and take very basic action.

I would also like to build a CI-CD pipeline for auto build and deployment.
The application should be hosted on AWS.
